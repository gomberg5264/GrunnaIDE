# Welcome

## Goal of project

This project is intended to do an web IDE that will compile and run the project in Docker containers. You should ether be able to run it localy at your computer/server or run it on our.
You can find my information on our [homepage](https://grunna.com)

## Contribution

We more then Welcome All the help we can get in all the areas, but we need you take some time to read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/grunna/GrunnaIDE/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) pages first.

## Other thoughts

All the code are at gitlab and is replicated over to github at the moment. I haven't decided if I should move over to github or not.
This is very early but I have get the basic up and running so at the moment I will focus on adding new feature and clean up bad code. Documentation is another area that I haven't prioritazed yet.
You can come to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/U4cN8tr) and have a chat how things are going. If you want to help that is a good starting point. Checking the issues are another good place to find out what is needed to be done 

Hope you will like this project
